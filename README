Start the application in the VM by opening a terminal, changing to the 
~/codejam-2011 directory, and running

python app.py

The application runs on http://localhost:3487/exchange/endpoint
The GUI can be accessed at http://localhost:3487/exchange/home

Remarks
=======
The app rarely (but occasionally) crashes after dumping some memory space
information.  Also had a couple of segfaults. Not sure what's causing this,
considering I'm using python -- something inside tornado? :s

I've had variable success with the time labels on the charts. What I have
now seems to work properly on Chrome and Firefox, at least.

The "Upload to Silanis" button when the snapshot is shown might appear at
the bottom of the page, which might be far far down...

All the dependencies are on the VM, but for reference, the app uses:

python 2.7 (haven't tested on earlier versions, but 2.5+ should be okay?)
    installed by default on the provided Ubuntu VM
tornado 2.1.1 
    available on pip
gviz_api 1.7.0 (Google visualization Python API)
    available at http://code.google.com/p/google-visualization-python/
twilio-python 3.3.3
    available on pip
